# scripts

## Purpose:

This folder contains the R scripts used for the ballistic movement project.

## Structure:

- `ballistic_movement_sim.R`: the code used to run a simulation for predator and prey movement over evolutionary timescales.
- `diagnostics.R`: contains the code needed for generating diagnostic figures for simulations.
- `functions.R`: contains the custom functions needed to run the simulations in all scripts.
- `plotting.R`: contains the code for creating the figures for the final analysis of the model outputs.
