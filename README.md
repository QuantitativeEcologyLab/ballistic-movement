# ballistic-movement

## Purpose:

Repository for Lynndsay Terpsma's 2025 URA project 
**"A Computational Approach to Identifying Evolutionarily Stable Strategies in Mammalian Search Behaviour"**
in Dr. Michael Noonan's Quantitative Ecology Lab at the University of British Columbia Okanagan. 
This project looks at the evolutionary trends in ballistic length scale under top-down and bottom-up pressures. 

## Structure: 
* `scripts/` contains the R script files for the coding of simulation models, functions, and figures.
* `simulations/` contains the .simulation outputs as `.Rda` files, as well as specialized scripts from supplementary and sensitivity analyses.
* `figures/` contains files for simulation results, including sensitivity, supplementary, and main text.
