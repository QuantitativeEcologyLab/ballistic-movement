Repository for Lynndsay Terpsma's 2025 URA project 
**"A Computational Approach to Identifying Evolutionarily Stable Strategies in Mammalian Search Behaviour"**
in Dr. Michael Noonan's Quantitative Ecology Lab at the University of British Columbia Okanagan. 
This project looks at the evolutionary trends in ballistic length scale under top-down and bottom-up pressures.
