# simulations/supplementary

## Purpose:

Contains the outputs from supplementary analyses that look at how metabolic costs affect movement parameters
and interactions.

## Parameters compared:
- speed and ballistic lengthscale.
- ballistic lengthscale and the number of patches visted.
- the number of net calories gained, predicted by a Generalized Additive Model.

## Structure:
