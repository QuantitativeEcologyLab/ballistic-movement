# Folder: simulations/prey_results

## Purpose:

Contains the outputs from simulations of prey individuals in the absence of predators.

Masses (grams) tested were:
  - 500 
  - 11000  
  - 21500  
  - 32000  
  - 42500  
  - 53000  
  - 63500  
  - 74000  
  - 84500 
  - 95000 
  - 105500
  - 116000
  - 126500
  - 137000 
  - 147500 
  - 158000 
  - 168500
  - 179000 
  - 189500 
  - 200000

## Parameters of simulations:

All simulations were run under the following assumptions, unless otherwise stated:
  - 20 individuals
  - 10 repetitions
  - 1000 generations
  - lowest possible value for kcal per patch for specific body mass, as determined via sensitivity analyses and subsequent trial and error.
