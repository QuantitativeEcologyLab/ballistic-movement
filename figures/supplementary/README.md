# Folder: figures/supplementary

## Purpose:
This folder contains figures used for the supplementary documents of the project. 

## How these were generated:
These plots were generated using the following scripts:
```r
source("scripts/cost_analsis.R")
```

`cost_vs_nocost_modelresults.png` visualises how metabolic costs change the predicted relationship
between speed and ballistic lengthscale and the subsequent net calorie gain
